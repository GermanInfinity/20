        <h3 class="expname">Junior Engineering Project - Dual Control Bottle</h3> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In a four man team, we developed a modified water bottle with two
compartments. One for water, and the other a mixing substance(i.e
Protein Shakes, Chocolate milk). Both compartments are separable, hence
makes water available before mixing. Goal is to eradicate carrying two
water bottles.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Developed a lighting design scheme for an 18 acre plot of land used for
recreational activity in Torresdale, PA. Implemented a simulation of the Mens Club Team, 2014-2015 LANGUAGES English, French design with Python and Philips Hue lighting system. The lights operated on with sensors, and programmed for events and seasonal change. Studies were carried out on the ecosystem, lighting design requirements, IEEE codes and
standards for outdoor lighting. I participated in a group of three, and was
primarily responsible for research and programming.</p>
